<center><h1> My First Blog Post! </h1></center>

<p>Continued from page 1: to ensure students specialized in curriculum and assessment design, development, evaluation, and implementation. Working in the K-12 school system for the past eight years has provided me with ample instructional design experience, from developing entire curriculums to individual instruction in the traditional, blended, and eLearning environments. I have done this in various L.M.S. such as Blackboard, Canvas, and Moodle.</p>

<p>By taking every opportunity to position myself towards gaining experience with I.D. methods and tools in the public education sector since starting the specialist degree in 2015, I have real world experience to couple with my degree. Although, the Specialist in education is considered a terminal degree in the corporate environment I have opted to continue and complete my doctorate. My thirst for knowledge and learning is unquenchable. This is a major reason I am attracted to the I.D. career path. Learning a various new skill and challenging my self to complete projects excites me.</p>

<p>The design aspect of creating instruction is a solid skill; I have developed over the past ten years. Although, my time in retail management before college provides me with many skills that relate to instructional design such as managing employees, collaborating with peers, ensuring daily operations are running properly, etcetera. However, the eLearning development aspect is a skill that needs to be perfected. This is where I am starting my journey and I hope my blog can one day be of assistance to someone else entering the profession.</p>

<p>Recently, I designed this HTML5 fully responsive website and hosted it on my server. I also, hosted Moodle and personalized the L.M.S. to display my work and practice the administration. Having previous knowledge of HTML has been very helpful in both these processes. I also started using the authoring tool H5P to ensure my Moodle courses are interactive and up to SCORM standards. Next, I plan to install Adapt to learn a new authoring tool.</p>

<p>It has been a blast and I am really looking forward to entering a fulltime role as an instructional designer in the near future.</p>

I am volunteering for Designers for Learning in their instructional evaluation service course. Essentially, it is an opportunity for veteran I.D.s to give back to society, or a place where newbies can gain actual hands on instructional design experience. While I have been designing instruction for the past seven years, I find it helpful to practice often. This program provides that opportunity to instructional designers from all walks of life.


I also completed their design in the open challenge, which has inspired me to be more open with my process so others can learn from my work flow. I have launched my personal portfolio and blog at www.chackras.com the site is a static HTML5 responsive site and it has taught me a lot about how to code. I started www.freecodecame.com and will be pursuing my certificates there too; although, I am going to take it slow. Maybe a couple hours a day?


 For my blog I decided to use Jekyll and host it on github because I wanted to keep my coding practice in use. Wordpress, and Ghost are awesome blogging platforms, but not very technical so I decided to go in this direction. My minimalist nature is very happy with the website and blog, but the minor fixes are annoying. It’s small stuff like the PHP not working correctly, google maps only working locally, and not on the server. I know these things will be fixed soon; I just have to keep plugging away at it.


Until next time…

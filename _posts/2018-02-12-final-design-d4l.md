The end product was an open source traditional (face-to-face) instructional component, and an e-learning design that could be used to complement the traditional instruction in a blended environment, or it could be used strictly as an e-learning tool. To do this I completed the traditional instruction first with an activity that grabs the attention of the learner by engaging them in real-world issues that currently affect the students, so they can see the value in the lesson. Merels First Principles of instruction was used to guide me and ensuring the lesson was meaningful to the adult learner.


<center><h4>Warm-Up
Time: 15 min
Job connection and strategic planning paper:</h4></center>


* Students prepare for job interviews by planning their personal career path.


* Have students brainstorm their 5 ideal jobs that they feel qualified for right now; which, they will write down.


* Students will list the salary expectations, and perceived job requirements.


* The teacher will then introduce the students to https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm


* Select various students and help them use glassdoor to look at salaries and the interview section to see what these questions look like.


* In classes where students have access to computers, tablets, or smartphones have the students research the jobs on their own and write down their results.


Research and writing are needed to understand the company, job requirements, and what the salary might be.


This lesson accomplished 2 task first it activates prior knowledge by asking students to plan their career path brainstorming jobs they have thought about doing. Then it introduces the students to a research website glassdoor that will help them in their job searches in the future. This hooks students in because it quickly provides a meaningful task that can be helpful to the students in the future.


The next step in the design process was to introduce the lesson to the student. In this portion of the lesson after the students’ attention has been focused activating prior knowledge is important to ensure learning gains are mane through connection of the material. To accomplish this the students are asked to popcorn out what they know about the subject.


<center><h4>Introduction
Time: 10  min</h4></center>


Explain that the students will be learning the proper procedures to Ace a professional job interview.


Activate prior knowledge by asking students to: Teacher create a chart with three sections on a blackboard, or whiteboard. Each section labeled as proper job interview behaviors, proper interview dress, and proper interview language. Have students’ popcorn-out their ideas about these categories and write them on the chart with different colors if possible compiling as many keywords as possible with the time allotted. These should stay on the board throughout the lesson and students should be encouraged to take notes.


Now the lesson is ready to be presented to the students as they are engaged, and primed to fully take in the lesson. To ensure the learner isn’t lost this process must chunk the new information students receive so they can fully grasp the material.


<center><h4>Main Lesson:
Time: 10 min</h4></center>


Have students watch https://youtu.be/3AgfK3R8Pgs then break into pairs and discuss the interview particularly the dress of the candidate, behavior of the candidate, and the speech of the candidate. One student from each group will share their findings with the class.

Have students watch https://youtu.be/naIkpQ_cIt0 then break into pairs and discuss the interview particularly the dress of the candidate, behavior of the candidate, and the speech of the candidate. One student from each group will share their findings with the class.


<center><h4>Time: 15 min</h4></center>


Go over the big three interview skills document with the students.


<center><h4>Time: 2 min</h4></center>


Distribute the Interview skills infographic.

Now that the lesson has been learned and the students have new knowledge it is important to practice what was learned by the students. To do this the students’ role play the interview process. A learning aid that was made also allows the students quick reference to the key concepts learned in the lesson. It’s important that this practice is guided by the teacher when possible so students receive feedback from an expert in the subject.


<center><h4>Guided Practice:
Time: 10 min</h4></center>

Pass out the Interview question hand out.


Put students into pairs. Have them take turns as interviewer and applicant. Encourage the applicants to use really bad interview behavior first. Keep this exercise to a timed 30 seconds for each applicant. This will get the students more aware of what bad behavior feels like and have some fun in the process. This should help relax any nervous tensions.


It is important that the instructor takes extensive notes and provides immediate constructive feedback along with praise to the students.


The evaluation process is an important component is any lesson because it solidifies the students understanding of the subject by asking them to recall the material. However, it also helps the teacher and instructional designer understand where they can redesign the lesson so that it is more effective and efficient. With this lesson being a tradition classroom style lesson a written test was provided to the teacher to test student understanding.


Finally, application of the skills learned is the end goal of the lesson. This is done through community based learning. Community based learning askes students to use the skills learned in an actually interview. This can be a mock interview, but it should be an simulation that is realistic as posable with the medium being used.


<center><h4>Application
Community Learning Project</h4></center>


**Option 1:** Students will complete a resume, cover letter, and thank you note with instructor guidance. Students will then complete several applications for the profession in which they wish to enter on indeed.com with instructor guidance online. Students will accept interviews, attend actual interviews in person, and report their experience to the class.


**Option 2:** Students will complete a resume, cover letter, and thank you note with instructor guidance. Students will attend a job-fair for the profession in which they wish to enter on indeed.com with instructor guidance online. Students will do as many interviews as they can and report their experience to the class.


**Option 3:** Students will complete a resume, cover letter, and thank you note with instructor guidance. The instructor will bring in a local small business owner, or send the students to their office for a mock interview. The student will report the experience to the class.

The e-learning component of the lesson was produced in easy to use open source tools eXe Learning, Powtoons, Adobe Captivate, Github, and Googledocs. Everything was open source and all the links, passwords, usernames, and documents are provided to the teachers so they can redesign any of the lesson they fell the need to. The concept of a fully open design such as this is somewhat worrisome because of the possibility that anyone can change the design. However, if the change is value added to the lesson then an open project such as this is an awesome design; my fear is that something more nefarious will happen to the design. I understand Captivate is not open source; however, anyone can use an email address to obtain a 30 day free trial to revamp anything they wish. It takes a little ingenuity but a fully open project can be made using the tools at your disposal online.

The decision was made to forgo the learner activation of prior knowledge and place more emphasis on the video components in the e-learning as this format will better grab the attention of the learners. All the handouts, and the test are incorporated into the e-learning design. Finally, a virtual interview have been developed that allows users to practice their skills as they would in the classroom. To provide coaching and feedback students’ responses are emailed back to the teacher. Finally, the community based project is incorporated into the lesson also.


 The e-learning design is HTML5 and fully responsive so that students can access the course on any devise. This is important because it allows students to access the course from anywhere, on any device, at any time. By allowing this type of flexibility it supports low-income students who need the course to improve their income prospects.
